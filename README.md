- [ ] Deploy a streamlit demo using a cloud service called maven
- [ ] Evaluate the performance of the prompts using a test database, human annotation, stretch LLM as a judge
- [ ] Create tests for the prompts (using pytest)
- [ ] Incorporate CI/CD using github actions
- [ ] Experiment with semantic search and if need be vector databases
- [ ] Create an agentic system that can generate memes in discord
